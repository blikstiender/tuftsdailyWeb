<h2>The Official Tufts Daily Online Guide for Editors</h2>

<br/>
<p><strong>I. Logging On </strong></p>

<p> Visit <a href="http://tuftsdaily.com/wp-admin">http://tuftsdaily.com/wp-admin</a> to reach the login page.</p>

<p> Your username should be FirstName LastName and your section editor should have emailed you your default password. Change your password after logging in by clicking the Profile tab in the left sidebar. If you cannot login, email me at <a href="mailto:online@tuftsdaily.com">online@tuftsdaily.com</a></p>

<p> Your dashboard should have a widget called "Unpublished Content." This will help you see how many articles are at what stage in the editing process. Click on one of the statuses to go to a page with those articles. You can also move around the widgets on the dashboard to convenient locations by clicking on the title and dragging them over.</p>

<p><strong>III. Editing Posts </strong></p>

<p>The three rounds of editing--Firsting, Seconding, and Exec'ing--are going to be done on WordPress. </p>

<p><strong> Firsting </strong></p>

<p> Firsting will still involve fact-checking and highlighting. To highlight text click the highlight button on the top left of the toolbar, as shown below.</p>

<p>To both make your lives easier and adhere to the standards of web journalism, help your writers get into the habit of hyperlinking to their sources as they write.</p> 

<p>In addition to fact-checking and highlighting, firsting will also involve making sure that tags and categories are properly set. You can scroll down for more info on how to setup categories and tags. </p>

<p>When finished firsting make sure to mark the post as Firsted (for the correct section) and click "Save." </p>

<p><strong> Seconding </strong></p>

<p> When seconding for web, make sure that all the unused text goes into the "Unused Text" box so that it will show up when the file gets XML'd. </p>

<p> When you are finished seconding, make sure to mark the post as Seconded (for the correct section) and click "Save." </p>

<p><strong> Exec'ing </strong></p>

<p> All the traditional metadata used to build XMLs can be found on the right side of the page, as shown above.</p>

<p> To add an image to a post, click on "Set featured Image" in the right sidebar." You should be able to find the correct image for the article in the media library.</p>

<p><strong>IV. Assigning Categories and Tags </strong></p>
<p> If you are check a subcategory such as "Album Review" make sure you also check the parent category (in this case, "Arts"). This way, when someone visits <a href="http://tuftsdaily.com/arts/">the arts page</a> they will see your post.

<p> Tags will show up on the post below the author circle. When someone clicks on a tag, they will see all the other articles with the same tags. Tag campus organizations, notable figures in the article, or any other important term that can help categorize the article.</p>

<p> You can find the box to add tags just below the box to add categories. </p>

<p><strong>V. Submitting a Post </strong><p>

<p> To move a post forward in the editing process, click the drop down arrow and choose the value based on the section you are writing for. Then click the save button.</p>

<p><strong>VI. Revisions </strong></p>

<p> Revisions let you see who edited the post and what exactly they changed. All revisions are stored on WordPress and backed up on another server. </p>

<p> The blue slider lets you scroll through previous revisions to see what editors or the writer changed. </p>

<p><strong>VII. Editorial Comments </strong></p>

<p> Editorial Comments do not leave WordPress or get published. They are a way for editors and writers to communicate or for editors to communicate with each other. They aren't necessary, but can probably be helpful in some cases. </p>
